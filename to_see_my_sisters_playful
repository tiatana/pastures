to see my sisters playful
i'll start with katiri, when she's cooking and in a fun mood
she'll waggle a spoon in your face and smile our grandmother's beautiful smile
or laurie, in a tree, with a sudden let's get down and go make cookies
sally, in garden, pruning smiling weeding smiling picking smiling
or robin crowling through the front wndows mkanig puns about innuendos,
mary, ribbing stanley about boats and waves and physics
alan says up on my sholders and I;ll wade you through the 
alligator-infested duck ponds to hunt for bird's nests in the reeds,
joe, a beatific smile, then a surprising academic reference, then beatific silence.
